* Based on physical health tests for 2852 youths from a Chinese university from September 2018 and
September 2019, using China’s National Student Physical Health Standard (NSPHS).
* Applying statistical testing like paired t-tests to examine statistical differences and using multiple
regression model to evaluate the associations between jogging and physical health.
* The Paper analyze the main factors affecting physical health of Chinese students, classifies the
statistical relationships between different environmental factors and give implications for improving
health.
