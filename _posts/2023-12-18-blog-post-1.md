This is a summary slides including my persona understanding of methodologies contained in the paper [Bayesian Forecasting of Cohort Fertility](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2014.881738). 


Notes

Please refer to my [slides](https://mister-he.github.io/_posts/Paper/Methodology_for_Fertility_model.pdf) here to get a better view of it.

Personal Thoughts
======
This is the first paper I read when I started my research in the area of Public Health. It impressed me a lot due to not onlt its elegant way of combining penalty terms and Bayesian Hierarchical Model together but also the creative way of applying SVD to extract the underlying linear trend in cohort fertility trend. I spent two weeks to finish all needed proofs and understanding, during the period it is filled with happiness and enthusiasm. It's more like a starting point to me.
