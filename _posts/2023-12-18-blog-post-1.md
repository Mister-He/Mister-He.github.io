Personal Thoughts
======
This is the first paper I read when I started my research in the area of Public Health. It impressed me a lot due to not onlt its elegant way of combining penalty terms and Bayesian Hierarchical Model together but also the creative way of applying SVD to extract the underlying linear trend in cohort fertility trend. I spent two weeks to finish all needed proofs and understanding, during the period it is filled with happiness and enthusiasm. It's more like a starting point to me.
